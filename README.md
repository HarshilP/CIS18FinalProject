# CIS18FinalProject

Project Creator: Harshil Patel

Version Number: 1.0

Date of Creation: July 25, 2019


Project Desciption:

This project revolves around the creation of a program that allows personal trainers advertise themselves by publishing the times they are available, their personal preferences, the rates they offer, and other criteria athletes might want to know. As for the athletes they would be able to rate the personal trainers they worked with, upload their own profile with preferences, and they would be able to sort through personal trainers based on their personal preferences.

Purpose of the program:

When looking for a personal trainer there are a lot of preferences you might have, but it could take a while to find the perfect trainer. With this program it would eliminate or make the process of finding the trainer. I would also make it easier for the athlete to communicate with the trainer through the in-app communication utilities, and it would help the trainer advertise themselves on a platform that makes it easier for athletes to find them.

Program Usage Instructions:

1. Download and compile all java files.
2. Execute the ProfileFunc.java file.
3. Create your username on the homepage.
4. Enter the hours you are available to work.
5. Enter other personal information.
6. Your profile is now created and you are able to look for other people now.

* Currently only the athlete profile creation page is working and the next step is to create the trainer creation page. *
